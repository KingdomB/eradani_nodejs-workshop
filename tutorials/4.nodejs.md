# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## Node.js

---

### **Introduction**

* Node.js is a powerful engine used by many large Fortune 500 Companies (PayPal and Walmart examples?).

### **What is Node.js?**

* V8 JavaScript runtime environment
* Runs your JavaScript outside of a browser, but has other capabilites
* APIs exposed that do things like file management, encryption, propogate errors, etc.
* Single-threaded, need to use asynchronous workers
* We've been using it in the previous examples!

### **How to Install Node.js (on the IBM i)**

* Refer back to setup?

---

### **How to use Node.js**

* using `node <file.js>` to run your program with Node
* Maybe some other interesting things here? Not sure how else to use it...

### **npm: The Node Package Manager**

One of the most compelling reasons to use Node.js is npm, The Node Package Manager. npm is a repository of over 940,000 open-source Node.js packages have been developed by members of the community, and can be found at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/). This makes npm the largest code repository in the entire world! To browse the packages available, simply visit the website and search in the bar for either the package name or by keywords.

The packages on range in size and scope from single-line functions that do very spcific data testing or manipulation, to entire frameworks for creating web servers and creating API endpoints. Many packages are updated very frequently and have tens of millions of downloads every week. As an example, the most popular package on npm, `lodash`, is a utility library that has 21 million weekly downloads.

Because these packages are open-source, you can go to any package, click on the link to its code repository, and see all of the code that is used to build the package. This allows you 

The best part of npm is that a lot of the boring, hard-to-implement functionality of software has already been done for you, allowing you to focus instead on writing the application logic for your business or project.

### **The `npm` utility**

When you download Node.js, in addition to the `node` command you also get the `npm` command. The `npm` utility helps install packages from [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) and manage the metadata for your program (e.g. version number, author name, specifying scripts, etc.).

When you create a Node.js project, usually the first thing you do is go to your project's directory and running `npm init`. This command will create a file called `package.json` that will store all of the metadata for your application. Although you don't _have_ to run `npm init` or even have a `package.json` to use Node.js, you will have to use it if you want to either

1. Push your package to be available on npm
2. Download any packages from npm using the `npm install` command.

So if `npm init` creates `package.json`, what does `package.json` do?// TODO:
* What is `package.json`
* How to install packages with `npm install`

### **Your First (Real) Node.js Application**

* use `npm init` to create your application
* Download a package or two
* require the packages in the main file
* run something interesting using JavaScript skills
