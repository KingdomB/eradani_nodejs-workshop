# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## **Setup**

### Please Note:

The day of the workshop, we will primarily be using a website called repl.it to easily run our JavaScript code and get familiar with Node.js. The JavaScript and Node.js skills you gain by using this website and the code you will write will be the exact same as the code that your run on our IBM i, with the exception of the IBM i-specific database and toolkit connectors.

The choice was made to avoid using the IBM i because connecting to the IBM i partition with a terminal, mounting the file system to be able to develop on your laptop, and troubleshooting issues with file and database permissions would take the majority of the time of the workshop. Nonetheless, instructions are given below to get Node.js working on your system

## **During the Workshop: repl.it**

## Example Repl.it Setup

To help us get to coding faster, we'll be using an online IDE for this workshop called **[Repl.it](https://Repl.it)**. Let's get started!

**Note: Projects on Repl.it are deleted after an hour unless you create a free account with them.** Please create an account if you want to take your code home with you!

### Getting Started with Repl.it

To start, head over to <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">**the Repl.it website**</a> and create a free account. Once you're logged in, hit the "new repl" button at the top of the dashboard. This should prompt you to search for and select a language. Repl.it supports many, many languages, but the two we'll be using in this workshop are **Nodejs** and **TypeScript**.

Let's go ahead and create a **Nodejs** project - you will be able to use this for the next workshop section.

Hit the "new repl" button, select **Nodejs**, name your project, and press "Create Repl" - Repl should take you to its online editor.

### The Repl.it Editor

The Repl.it editor is divided into three columns:

* **Files** on the left side lists the files and folders in your project.
* **Editor** in the center is where you edit a particular file.
* **Console** on the right shows output from your project.

There is also a thin sidebar at the far left edge with a few options, which manipulate the **Files** section:

* The **page** icon switches the Files section to list project files.
* The **cube** icon switches the Files section to list Packages (open-source dependencies) of your project. The Packages interface is used to add packages to your project, which we'll do frequently once we get to Node and Express.
* The **people** icon starts up Multiplayer mode, which you can use to collaborate on a single Repl.it project with multiple people.
* The **gear** icon will show basic editor settings such as font size and indent size.

**Finally, and perhaps most importantly,** the **Console** section of the editor shows the base URL of your project at the top. Once you create a Node server in your Repl, it will be publicly accessible at that URL.

_We're relying on you to figure out what the bright green "run" button at the top of the editor does._

## **After the Workshop: Setting up Node.js (and your Environment) on your IBM i**

### Connecting to your workshop IBM i

### **The IBM i Open-Source Environment**

Before you can use Node.js on your IBM i, you will need to install the open-source environment. The primary component of the open-source environment is `yum`, or "Yellowdog Updater, Modified", which is a utility that can be used to install and update software on your IBM i while also keeping track of and maintaining the dependencies for that software. Unlike most software on the IBM i, which is delivered through PTFs, `yum` is used to deliver all of the open-source software on IBM i, so it is an important utility to become familiar with.

There are three ways that you can install the open-source environment:

**NOTE:** All of the methods for installing the open-source environment require `*ALLOBJ` authority for the user attempting the installation.

**NOTE:** Methods 1 and 2 currently requires that your PC has direct FTP access to the public IBM file server. Many companies now block FTP access. If that is the case, refer to Method 3. "Offline Install Instructions (without ACS)".

1. **Access Client Solutions (ACS)**
    * If you do not have ACS installed on your development machine (such as your laptop), it can be downloaded at https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1026805
    * If you have not set up your IBM i configuration in ACS, you will need to do so now by selecting `System Configuration` under `Management` in the side menu.
    * With your system selected in the left menu, go to `Tools` in the top menu and select `Open Source Package Management`.
    * If you do not have the open-source environment installed, you will be prompted with `Open source environment not installed! Would you like to install now?`. Select `Yes`, and then wait for the installation to finish.

2. **Online Installation with `boostrap.sql`**

3. **Offline Installation with `bootstrap.sql`**

### **Installing Node.js on your IBM i**


* Have to get the open-source environment on your IBM i.
* With open-source environment, should just run `yum install nodejs10`.
* NONE OF THIS MAY BE POSSIBLE. You need ALLOBJ authority to do the above, which they might not have.

### Connecting to your PASE on your IBM i with SSH

* Oh my god this could _really_ take a long time. I can see all sorts of issues people have...
