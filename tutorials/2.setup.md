# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## Setup

### Connecting to your workshop IBM i

* I think we will have to use IBM i for this workshop.
* **Aaron:** I'm not as sure, though we can talk more about this at our next meeting. My main concern is that there are a lot of potential points of failure in a setup process that is this complex. Given our extremely limited time, I'd rather avoid environment alltogether. Repl.it has full Javascript, Node, and Typescript support, so I'd prefer to use it. I added an example setup section at the bottom if we do decide to go with Repl.it.

### Installing Node.js on your IBM i

* Have to get the open-source environment on your IBM i.
* With open-source environment, should just run `yum install nodejs10`.
* NONE OF THIS MAY BE POSSIBLE. You need ALLOBJ authority to do the above, which they might not have.

### Connecting to your PASE on your IBM i with SSH

* Oh my god this could _really_ take a long time. I can see all sorts of issues people have...

## Example Repl.it Setup

To help us get to coding faster, we'll be using an online IDE for this workshop called **[Repl.it](https://Repl.it)**. Let's get started!

**Note: Projects on Repl.it are deleted after an hour unless you create a free account with them.** Please create an account if you want to take your code home with you!

### Getting Started with Repl.it

To start, head over to <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">**the Repl.it website**</a> and create a free account. Once you're logged in, hit the "new repl" button at the top of the dashboard. This should prompt you to search for and select a language. Repl.it supports many, many languages, but the two we'll be using in this workshop are **Nodejs** and **TypeScript**.

Let's go ahead and create a **Nodejs** project - you will be able to use this for the next workshop section.

Hit the "new repl" button, select **Nodejs**, name your project, and press "Create Repl" - Repl should take you to its online editor.

### The Repl.it Editor

The Repl.it editor is divided into three columns:

* **Files** on the left side lists the files and folders in your project.
* **Editor** in the center is where you edit a particular file.
* **Console** on the right shows output from your project.

There is also a thin sidebar at the far left edge with a few options, which manipulate the **Files** section:

* The **page** icon switches the Files section to list project files.
* The **cube** icon switches the Files section to list Packages (open-source dependencies) of your project. The Packages interface is used to add packages to your project, which we'll do frequently once we get to Node and Express.
* The **people** icon starts up Multiplayer mode, which you can use to collaborate on a single Repl.it project with multiple people.
* The **gear** icon will show basic editor settings such as font size and indent size.

**Finally, and perhaps most importantly,** the **Console** section of the editor shows the base URL of your project at the top. Once you create a Node server in your Repl, it will be publicly accessible at that URL.

_We're relying on you to figure out what the bright green "run" button at the top of the editor does._
