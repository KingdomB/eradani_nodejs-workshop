# **POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop**

## **Conclusion**

Node.js is a powerful tool for quickly creating applications to sit on top of your existing business logic. Through a number of packages developed by the IBM i Open-Source Software Team, Node.js can interact directly with the IBM i, calling RPG programs, CL commands, and interacting with the Db2 database. Furthermore, with nearly 1 million open-source packages available on NPM, you can leverage battle-tested code as the foudnation for your application, allowing you to focus on writing your business' application logic!

We hope that this lab has given you a solid foundation to continue your Node.js education. In this session, we learned how to develop in JavaScript, became familiar with the Node.js runtime, and developed an application to serve up IBM i Db2 data using Express.js. We have also included a few extension lessons in this lab covering TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that allows for strong typing, and LoopBack, an application framework that allows object-relation mapping with Db2 and can generate secure APIs for your in an instant. These extensions can be done at your own pace later.

Although we didn't do a deep dive on how to interact with your IBM i through a remote or local Node.js processes, there are a number of resources that can continue to help you in that area. Foremost, checkout the nearly one dozen other Node.js sessions at POWERUp2019. These sessions are given by many knowledgable and influential members of the Node.js and IBM i community, and are certain to have great insight into the value Node.js can bring to your business. Other great resources are the NPM pages for the Node.js packages that the IBM i Open-Source Software Team has developed for interacting with the IBM i, including:

* [itoolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itoolkit)
* [idb-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-connector)
* [idb-pconnector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-pconnector)
* [odbc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/odbc)
* [loopback-connector-ibmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loopback-connector-ibmi)
