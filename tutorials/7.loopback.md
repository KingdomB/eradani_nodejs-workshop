### **Introduction**

LoopBack is a Node.js framework that allows you to quickly create REST API endpoints that can turn your IBM i (or any system) into a data server. Through an easy to use CLI, you can create models, define data sources (such as Db2 on your IBM i, or multiple IBM is), and generate secure endpoints that other data services can connect to in order to create, read, update, and delete select records from your system.

LoopBack is officially supported by IBM, and the connector for Db2 on IBM i, like many other IBM i Node.js packages, is maintained by the IBM i open-source software team. Furthermore, there are support options available through IBM that allow you to get the help you need when you have issues using Loopback.

Because not all features appear to be supported in Loopback 4 at the time of writing this workshop, the tutorials below will be written using LoopBack 3. As soon as LoopBack 4 has the functionality of the earlier version, the IBM i open-source software team will create LoopBack 4 examples and host them on our [GitHub IBM i Open-Source Software Examples repository](https://github.com/ibm/ibmi-oss-examples). The IBM i connector for LoopBack will be tested to ensure compatability with both versions.

And with that, let's get started developing REST APIs with LoopBack! If you aren't sure was a REST API is, or why you would want to create one, feel free to [do a little reading](https://restfulapi.net/). These lab instructions aren't going anywhere!

### **Setting up ODBC on your Development Machine**

`loopback-connector-ibmi` connects to your IBM i through the ODBC driver, so that will have to be installed before you can use Loopback on your IBM i.

The great side benefit is that once you set up ODBC to connect to your IBM i, you can use the `odbc` package outside of loopback. The Node.js `odbc` package is maintained by the IBM i Open-Source Software Team, and is the preferred method of connecting to Db2 both from your development machines and from on your IBM i itself.

The first important thing to do is set up your `odbc.ini` file.

* Setting up the DSN
* Creating a connection string
* Connection string can be used by any number of packages that connect using odbc!

### **Downloading LoopBack and the IBM i LoopBack Connector**

Like many great Node.js packages, the LoopBack Connector for the IBM i is available freely on npm (and being open-source, you can even see and contribute to our effort!). To install into your application, simply run:

```
$ npm install loopback-connector-ibmi
```

This will install a connector for LoopBack that knows exactly how to talk to the Db2 on your IBM i. Beccause this connector uses the ODBC database connector, you can develop your LoopBack application on any machine and still have your API connect to Db2 on your IBM i.
