## LoopBack

LoopBack on the IBM i, connecting through ODBC.

---

### **Setting up ODBC on your Development Machine**

`loopback-connector-ibmi` connects to your IBM i through the ODBC driver, so that will have to be installed before you can use Loopback on your IBM i.

The great side benefit is that once you set up ODBC to connect to your IBM i, you can use the `odbc` package outside of loopback. The Node.js `odbc` package is maintained by the IBM i Open-Source Software Team, and is the preferred method of connecting to Db2 both from your development machines and from on your IBM i itself.

The first important thing to do is set up your `odbc.ini` file.

* Setting up the DSN
* Creating a connection string
* Connection string can be used by any number of packages that connect using odbc!
