# **POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop**

## iToolKit

### Intro to iToolKit

Congratulations on getting this far! With all of the material you've covered, you're now ready to hit the real purpose of this lab: getting the latest, cutting-edge, open-source technologies to interact with existing IBM i applications. In this section, we will move our Express server over to our IBM i LPARs and set the servers up to **interact directly with DB2 on the i!**

We do this using a wonderful open-source tool called iToolKit. **This toolkit is available on NPM, but we use a slightly modified version for this lab, available at the github repo: `github:dromonaco/nodejs-itoolkit`. 

The first step is to get set up on the LPARs, which we will take some time now to set up. During this point in the workshop, we will be distributing all of the necessary information for connecting to your LPAR's PASE environment and starting up Node there for development. **We will move on to the next section once this process is complete, so please bear with us for a few minutes.**
