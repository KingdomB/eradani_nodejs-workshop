# **POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop**

## iToolKit

### Intro to iToolKit

Congratulations on getting this far! With all of the material you've covered, you're now ready to hit the real purpose of this lab: getting the latest, cutting-edge, open-source technologies to interact with existing IBM i applications. In this section, we will move our Express server over to our IBM i LPARs and set the servers up to **interact directly with DB2 on the i!** This process will effectively generalize to any other commands available on your IBM i, meaning that once this section is complete, you will have all of the basic tools required for your IBM i applications to tap into the world open-source web technology!

We will achieve this using a wonderful open-source tool called iToolKit. **This toolkit is available on NPM, but we use a slightly modified version for this lab, available at this github repo, provided by our own Dave Romo: `github:dromonaco/nodejs-itoolkit`. 

The first step is to get set up on the LPARs, which we will take some time now to set up. During this point in the workshop, we will be distributing all of the necessary information for connecting to your LPAR's PASE environment and starting up Node there for development. **We will move on to the next section once this process is complete, so please bear with us for a few minutes.**

### Moving Our Server Over to the i

Now that we have Node up and running, we are going to move our Express applications from the previous section of the workshop to the i. We need two files for this: a `package.json` file and the main `app.js` file, both of which are provided below. In your terminal, you will need to create these two files and copy/paste their respective code into them.

You can create the files with the following two commands:

```bash
touch package.json
touch app.js
```

Then, you can manually retype the contents of each file or copy/paste them. If you decide to copy/paste them, copy the contents for the `package.json` file now (available below), then open up the `package.json` file in a text editor with the following command:

```bash
nano package.json
```

Once you have pasted or retyped the contents of the file, press `Ctrl+O` and then `Enter` to save the file, then `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor. Now repeat for the `app.js` file.

**In the app.js file, don't forget to set the port number for your application!** In the final line of app.js, you will see `server.listen('<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>');`. You have been provided with a port number - please replace the entire text string with that number (including the quotes). For example, if your port number is `2019`, then the line should be: `server.listen(2019);`.

`package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "common-workshop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "request": "^2.88.0",
    "request-promise": "^4.2.4",
    "itoolkit": "github:dromonaco/nodejs-itoolkit"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

`app.js`
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen('<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>');
```

Once you have copied the two files, you will need to install the NPM dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

**This command may take a bit to run.**

Once it completes, run your Node application with `node app.js`.

You should then be able to navigate to the URL of the LPAR, followed by your port number in your browser to see "Hello Internet!". The URL will follow this format: `http://<LPAR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/`. For example, if the LPAR address was `www.yourlpar.com` and the port was `2019`, the full URL would be `http://www.yourlpar.com:2019/`.

If you see "Hello Internet!" in your browser, congratulations! You now have a Node application running on the IBM i! In the next section, we will add a '/people' route that will retrieve real data from the DB2 database on the i.

### Connecting to DB2

It's surprisingly simple to work with our iToolKit for Node. The first step would be to install the iToolKit package. However, we actually already took care of this while setting up the LPARs. If you would like, check out the `package.json` file that we have for our current server. Under dependencies, you should see `itoolkit` installed! If it isn't there, add it to the list by adding `"itoolkit": "github:dromonaco/nodejs-itoolkit"` into the dependencies list, saving the file, and then running `npm install` to install the dependency package.

Now, the first thing we are going to do is import `itoolkit` by adding the following line to the top of our `app.js` file:

```javascript
const itoolkit = require('itoolkit');
```

Then, we will add a new route at `/people` which will will fill in later. Add the following code in the same area as the other routes we've created:

```javascript
app.get('/people', function (request, response) {
    // Fill in later!
});
```

Your complete server file should now look something like this. If you decide to copy/paste this file, **make sure that your port number is still right at the bottom of the file!**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

// Import iToolKit
const itoolkit = require('itoolkit');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

// New Route!
app.get('/people', function (request, response) {
    // Fill in later!
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen('<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>');
```

Great! Now, it takes a bit of code to set up a connection with DB2, prepare a command, and execute it, so we're going to do all of this in a separate function. For now, feel free to copy and paste this function at the bottom of your `app.js` file. We will go through it in a moment. **Make sure to replace the `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` text with your LPAR username and password!**

```javascript
// Configuration options
const xmlConfig = {
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
    "connection": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 47700,
        "path": "/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm",
    }
};
// Function to send SQL queries to DB2 to execute
function executeQuery(sql) {
    // Create a new Promise
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Open a connection to DB2
        const conn = new itoolkit.iConn("*LOCAL", xmlConfig.username, xmlConfig.password, xmlConfig.connection);

        // Create a SQL command using the text in the sql variable at the top of this function
        const command = new itoolkit.iSql();
        command.addQuery(sql);
        command.fetch();
        command.free();
        conn.add(command);

        // Run the SQL command, and then return the result
        conn.run((response) => {
            resolve(response);
        });
    });
}
```

Once you paste this code in, we won't have done anything with it yet, so the function will not run. The next step is to update our route so that it runs this function and passes it the SQL command `SELECT * FROM PEOPLE`. We have already created the `PEOPLE` table for you in DB2. We can run this SQL command by calling our function from inside our `/people` route with this code:

```javascript
    return executeQuery('SELECT * FROM PEOPLE')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        });
```

This code will run our function, and then take the Promise which it returns and attach a `.then()` handler to it. This means that once DB2 returns a result from our query, lines 3 and 4 will be run with the result data from the query available in the `result` variable.

Our completed server file should now look like this:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

// Import iToolKit
const itoolkit = require('itoolkit');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

// New Route!
app.get('/people', function (request, response) {
    return executeQuery('SELECT * FROM PEOPLE')
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result);
        response.end(result);
    });
});

// Configuration options
const xmlConfig = {
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
    "connection": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 47700,
        "path": "/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm",
    }
};
// Function to send SQL queries to DB2 to execute
function executeQuery(sql) {
    // Create a new Promise
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Open a connection to DB2
        const conn = new itoolkit.iConn("*LOCAL", xmlConfig.username, xmlConfig.password, xmlConfig.connection);

        // Create a SQL command using the text in the sql variable at the top of this function
        const command = new itoolkit.iSql();
        command.addQuery(sql);
        command.fetch();
        command.free();
        conn.add(command);

        // Run the SQL command, and then return the result
        conn.run((response) => {
            resolve(response);
        });
    });
}

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen('<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>');
```

**If you copy/paste this code make sure your `port`, `username`, and `password` are all correct!**

And now, for the moment of truth. Once your have made sure your server is up-to-date, run the server with the command:

```bash
node app.js
```

Wait a few seconds for the application to start up, then navigate to the URL of your application in your browser. Remember, the format for the URL is `http://<LPAR_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/`. If you see 'Hello Internet!' in your browser, then your server is running, and it is time to check if our DB2 operation works.

Navigate to the `/people` route in your browser. The URL format in this case would be `http://<LPAR_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/people`. It may take a few seconds for this operation to complete, but once it does, you should see some XML text in the browser window, and interspersed in the angle brackets (<,>), you should see `name`s and `age`s of the `people` in the database!
