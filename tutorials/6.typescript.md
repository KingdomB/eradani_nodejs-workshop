### **Introduction**

JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, meaning that variables can be Numbers one minute, Strings another, and Booleans another. Additionally, when you pass values to functions through parameters, no type-checking is done by the engine, and in fact you can pass more of fewer parameters than the function requires.

While these language features can be great for writing simple scripts or small programs, they can be a real headache for developing enterprise-level software with large development teams. Unless your documentation is robust, other developers will need to study code before they can be comfortable using functions or classes developed using JavaScript. Furthermore, doing object-oriented development in JavaScript can be a real chore, forcing you to call a number of functions in order to do simple things like extending a superclass or implementing an interface.

To remedy these issues, Microsoft developed TypeScript, superset of JavaScript that features not only strongly-typed variables and function parameters, but also enables object-oriented programming techniques and syntax similar to Java or C#. TypeScript is a true superset of JavaScript in that all JavaScript is valid TypeScript. This allows you to use TypeScript only as much as you want, and JavaScript everywhere else! However, because Node.js doesn't know how to read TypeScript, our TypeScript code must be _transpiled_ into JavaScript before it can be run.

Below we will go through the steps of setting up TypeScript, basic TypeScript syntax, how to transpile to JavaScript, and how to use TypeScript to write code that will be much maintainable programs. We are sure you will see the value of developing using TypeScript

### **Setup**

* npm install typescript -g
* `tsconfig.json`?

### **First TypeScript Program**

For our first program in TypeScript, we are going to simply write JavaScript! That might seem weird, but it is to demonstrate that TypeScript must be transpiled into JavaScript in order to be run in Node.js.

```TypeScript
function greeter(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

let user = "Jane User";
greeter(user);
```

[//]: # (Do some Transpile and run stuff here)

```TypeScript
function greeter(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

let user = "Jane User";
greeter(user);
```
