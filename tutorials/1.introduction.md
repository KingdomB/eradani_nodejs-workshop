# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the process of getting Node.js installed on your machine, learning JavaScript, using JavaScript with Node.js, and creating an Express.js server to connect your IBM i to the wider world.

Throughout the workshop, we will strive to explain things in sufficient detail so there are few if any 'black boxes' that you are expected to use but not understand.
