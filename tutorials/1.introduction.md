## **Introduction**

Node.js is perhaps the most popular programming language in the world today, used by many Fortune 500 companies to automate internal processes, augment existing workflows, and create external services to connect to their legacy systems. Node.js is supported and maintained by many large organizations such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Joyent, who work to ensure that it remains a powerful technology for enterprise-level development. (To learn more, see the [Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/)).

Fortunately, Node.js is fully supported on the IBM i, allowing you to utilize its power to extend the capabilities of your current applications in ways you never thought possible. Although it may seem scary and foreign at first, with a little practice you will soon see that Node.js is really quite simple to use, and allows you to develop modern programs on your IBM i orders of magnitude faster than any other tool.

This workshop will walk you through the process of getting Node.js installed on your machine, teach you JavaScript from square one, show how to use JavaScript with Node.js, and finally teach you how to use the Eradani Connect Framework to securely connect your IBM i resources to the wider world. There are also bonus lessons on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that makes developing large applications less error-prone and more maintainable. The entirety of this workshop will be available on the [Eradani GitHub](https://github.com/eradani-inc/nodejs-workshop).

Throughout the workshop, we will strive to explain concepts in sufficient detail so there are few if any 'black boxes' that you are expected to use without a complete understanding. At times it may seem like we are going slow, but deeply understanding the basics of both JavaScript and Node.js will lay a strong foundation for development after the conclusion of the workshop.

If you have any questions after the conclusion of the workshop, feel free to reach out to to Aaron Magid (aaron@eradani.com), or post an issue on the [GitHub repository for this workshop](https://github.com/eradani-inc/nodejs-workshop).
