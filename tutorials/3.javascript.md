# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## JavaScript

### Introduction

JavaScript was originally created for manipulating HTML inside the browser.

JavaScript is:

* weakly typed
* interpreted
* functional
* prototype-based

One of the reasons JavaScript is so popular is that it is easy to learn and use. Because it is weakly typed, developers do not have to worry about keeping track of data types. As we will eventually see in this lab, that can be an issue, but for now we will consider it a positive of JavaScript.

### Your First Steps with JavaScript

// TODO: talk about using Node.js, with IBM i. How to do it, but don't worry about Node.js just yet.

### 1. Hello World

As with any new programming language, we will start with a Hello World program. In the editing section of your file, write the following line of code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```

`console` is a simple debugging console exposed by Node.js (and is provided in browsers as well) that allows developers to print to `process.stdout` and `process.stderr`.
The `log` function of the console will print data to `prcoess.stdout`, which will display on your terminal.

In this example, we simply the the console to log the string `'Hello World'`, which we then should see in the terminal to the right of our editor.

To run your program, simply press **run** at the top of the page, and observe the output to the right. You should see `Hello World`, and with that, you've written your first JavaScript program!

**Note:** In JavaScript, you can declare strings with either single or double quotes. Single quotes are more common, but it is more important to just pick a style and stick with it. For these examples, we will prefer single quotes.

### 2. Hello Variable

In our first example, we simply printed out a string that we provided directly to `console.log`. But what if we wanted to print out a variable? In this example, we will create a variable to store our string, and then pass that variable to `console.log`. In a new file, write the following code:


```javascript
const message = 'Hello Variable';
console.log(message);
```

Here, we assign the string `"Hello Variable"` to the variable `message`. In JavaScript, we declare variables with the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const`. We will cover the different behaviors of these variable declarations in an upcoming example, but for now, just know that the following guidelines follow for use:

* `const`: Your default variable declaration. Variable cannot be reassigned.
* `let`: If you need to reassign a variable, change use `let` instead of `const`.
* `var`: The old way of declaring variables. *Do not use `var`, unless you know why you need to use it.*

When you run your file, you should see "Hello Variable" printed to the console. You've just created and used your first variable!

### 3. Reassigning Variables

Let's see how we can reassign variables (and variable types) in JavaScript. In your editor, enter the following code:

```javascript
let val = 'One';
console.log(val);
val = 1
console.log(val);
```

Much like the previous example, we assign a string to a variable. This time, we use the `let` keyword instead of the `const` keyword, because we are going to reassign its value. This time we assign the string 'One', and then log it to the console.

Then, we reassign the value of our variable to 1. Note that 1 is not a string, like the value the variable held before, but is instead a number. These are two distinct variable types in JavaScript. In many language, you cannot reassign a variable to a value of another type, but JavaScript is loosely typed and every variable can hold any type of value.

We then print our number, to the console, just to see that the value was really changed.

### 4. JavaScript Types

You may come across blogs or posts on the internet that claim JavaScript has no types, but this is not true. In fact, there are 7 types in JavaScript:

6 Primitive Types:
* String: Represents textual data, assigned by wrapping text in single or double quotes.
* Number: Numerica data, which can be either either integers (e.g. 1,-1, 9007199254740991) or floating point numbers (e.g. 0.1, -0.1, 4093.342).
* Boolean: Either `true` or `false`.
* Undefined: A variable that hasn't been assigned a value or the value returned from a function that doesn't specify a returned value will be `undefined`.
* Null: Can only be `null`. Not to be confused with `undefined`, `null` is often used to indicate a value has been set, but there is no value.

1 Composite Type:
* Object: A collection of properties, which are primitive values or other objects. Functions are objects that can be called (which sounds a lot more confusing than it is). Objects are an important part of JavaScript, and we will cover them soon.

As we saw in the previous example, you cannot specify the type of a variable in JavaScript explicitly, and a variables type can be reassigned at will. To see what the current type of a variable is, we can use the `typeof` operator, which returns a string representation of the type (e.g. 'string', 'number', 'undefined', etc.).

### Conclusion

Through the eight examples above, we have walked through the basics of programming with JavaScript.

In the next session, we will look at how you can use your new skills to develop JavaScript applications with Node.js.
