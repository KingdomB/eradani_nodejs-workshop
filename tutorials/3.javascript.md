# POWERUp2019 Node.js Workshop

## **JavaScript**
---

### **Introduction**

JavaScript was originally created for manipulating HTML inside the browser, but has spread in recent years to web servers as Node.js and even cross-platform native applications through systems like [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

JavaScript is:

* weakly typed
* interpreted ([kind of](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/138521/is-javascript-interpreted-by-design))
* functional
* prototype-based

One of the reasons JavaScript is so popular is that it is quick to learn and use. Because it is weakly typed, developers do not have to worry about keeping track of data types, which allows for greatly increased development speed. As we will eventually see in this lab, that can become an issue in larger projects, but for now we will use it to our advantage.

### Your First Steps with JavaScript

// TODO: talk about using Node.js, with IBM i. How to do it, but don't worry about Node.js just yet.

**Fun fact:** JavaScript, despite its name and syntax similarities, has no technical relation to Java. The standards for JavaScript are specified as ECMAScript - the implementation used for browsers and now Node.js was named JavaScript as part of a marketing deal between Netscape and Sun, and the name stuck.

### **1. Hello World**

As with any new programming language, we will start with a Hello World program. In the editing section of your file, write the following line of code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World'); // will print out 'Hello World'
```
Our simple one-line example illustrates some important parts of JavaScript. First, note that I created a comment after the code with `//`. When you start a comment with `//`, everything that comes after is treated as a comment and is not executed. You can also create multi-line comments using `/*` to begin and `*/` to end.

Also note that the line we execute ends with a semicolon (`;`). Although semicolons are _technically_ optional due to automatic semicolon insertion, **it is considered best practice to always use semicolons at the end of statements**.

We also use `console.log` to print out data from our program to the console. `console` is a simple debugging console exposed by Node.js (and is provided in browsers as well) that allows developers to print to `process.stdout` and `process.stderr`. The `log` function of the console will print data to `prcoess.stdout`, which will display on your terminal.

In this example, we simply the the console to log the string `'Hello World'`, which we then should see in the terminal to the right of our editor.

To run your program, simply press **run** at the top of the page, and observe the output to the right. You should see `Hello World`, and with that, you've written your first JavaScript program!

**Note:** In JavaScript, you can declare strings with either single or double quotes. Single quotes are more common, but it is more important to just pick a style and stick with it. For these examples, we will prefer single quotes.

---

### **2. Hello Variable**

In our first example, we simply printed out a string that we provided directly to `console.log`. But what if we wanted to print out a variable? In this example, we will create a variable to store our string, and then pass that variable to `console.log`. In a new file, write the following code:


```javascript
const message = 'Hello Variable';
console.log(message);
```

Here, we assign the string `"Hello Variable"` to the variable `message`. In JavaScript, we declare variables with the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const`. We will cover the different behaviors of these variable declarations in an upcoming example, but for now, just know that the following guidelines follow for use:

* `const`: Your default variable declaration. Variable cannot be reassigned.
* `let`: If you need to reassign a variable, change use `let` instead of `const`.
* `var`: The old way of declaring variables. *Do not use `var`, unless you know why you need to use it.*

When you run your file, you should see "Hello Variable" printed to the console. You've just created and used your first variable!

---

### **3. Reassigning Variables**

Let's see how we can reassign variables (and variable types) in JavaScript. In your editor, enter the following code:

```javascript
let val = 'One';
console.log(val);
val = 1
console.log(val);
```

Much like the previous example, we assign a string to a variable. This time, we use the `let` keyword instead of the `const` keyword, because we are going to reassign its value. This time we assign the string 'One', and then log it to the console.

Then, we reassign the value of our variable to 1. Note that 1 is not a string, like the value the variable held before, but is instead a number. These are two distinct variable types in JavaScript. In many language, you cannot reassign a variable to a value of another type, but JavaScript is loosely typed and every variable can hold any type of value.

We then print our number, to the console, just to see that the value was really changed.

---

### **4 If/Else and Control Flow**

In JavaScript, we often want to execute some code conditionally. We usually accomplish this with an `if` statement.This is similar to many modern languages, and allows us to test the truthfulness of some statement to control to conditionally control the flow of our program. 

`if` can be used by itself to do something if a condition is true:

```javascript
console.log('start');
if (true) {
  console.log('This will execute!');
}
console.log('end');
```

Note that we wrap the statement that we are going to execute conditionally in a block of `{ }`. This creates a block, and everything inside will be executed if the condition is true. After the block is executed, the code will continue outside the block. In this case, our program should print:

```
start
This will execute!
end
```

`if` can also be used with `else` to branch between two flows depending on the condition of some statement.

```javascript
console.log('start');
if (true) {
  console.log('This will execute!');
} else {
  console.log('This will not execute!');
}
console.log('end');
```

With an `if/else` statement, the program executes either the `if` block if the condition returns `true`, or the `else` block if the if condition returns `false`. In this case, since we pass true, the if block will always be run.

```
start
This will execute!
end
```

Finally, `if` statements can be extended to use `else if`, which will execute if a condition is true only if all above `if`s and `else if`s are false. In your editor, enter the following code:

```javascript
const number = 6;
if (number === 5) {
  console.log('The number is 5');
} else if (number === 6 ) {
  console.log('The number is 6');
} else if (number % 2 === 0) {
  console.log('The number is even');
} else {
  console.log('Catch all!');
}
```

The output of your program should be `The number is 6`. If we visually trace the flow of the program, we see that the `if` statement will return false, because `(number === 5)` will evaluate to false. Next, the program will get to the `else if (number === 6)`, which will evaluate to true and so `The number is 6` will be printed. Note that the next `else if` that checks `(number % 2 === 0)` (which is the way to check if a number is divisible by 2) will also evaluate to true! But because it is part of the same `if/else if/else` block, it will not be evaulated and `The number is even` will not be printed.

Controlling the flow of your program conditionally is an important part of understanding any programming language, so make sure that you understand how `if` statements work!

### **5. JavaScript Types**

You may come across blogs or posts on the internet that claim JavaScript has no types, but this is not true. In fact, there are 7 types in JavaScript:

6 Primitive Types:
* String: Represents textual data, assigned by wrapping text in single or double quotes.
* Number: Numerica data, which can be either either integers (e.g. 1,-1, 9007199254740991) or floating point numbers (e.g. 0.1, -0.1, 4093.342).
* Boolean: Either `true` or `false`.
* Undefined: A variable that hasn't been assigned a value or the value returned from a function that doesn't specify a returned value will be `undefined`.
* Null: Can only be `null`. Not to be confused with `undefined`, `null` is often used to indicate a value has been set, but there is no value.

1 Composite Type:
* Object: A collection of properties, which are primitive values or other objects. Functions are objects that can be called (which sounds a lot more confusing than it is). Objects are an important part of JavaScript, and we will cover them soon.

As we saw in the previous example, you cannot specify the type of a variable in JavaScript explicitly, and a variables type can be reassigned at will. To see what the current type of a variable is, we can use the `typeof` operator, which returns a string representation of the type (e.g. 'string', 'number', 'undefined', etc.).

The next example demonstrates some of the weakly-typed gotchas that exists in JavaScript.

```javascript
let stringVar = '1';
let numVar = 1;

console.log(typeof stringVar); // should return 'string'
console.log(typeof numVar); // should return 'number'

// heres where things get fun...
if (stringVar == numVar) {
  console.log('Variables are equal.')
} else {
  console.log('Variables were not equal.');
}
```

What do you think the if/else block prints after we compare the string `'1'` to the number `1`? One might reasonably assume that the equality test doesn't pass, and `Variables were not equal` is printed to the console. However, you might be surprised to see that the code example prints out `Variables are equal.`. Why is this?

In JavaScript, the `==` operator will test for equality between two values, but if it can it will convert the values to the same type before the comparison is made. In our example, it will convert the values to be the same type, and _then_ compare them, at which point they are equal. This is one of the most common code bugs in JavaScript, and so it is important to keep in mind.

If instead you want to do strict comparison between two values, where no type conversion is done, then use `===`, the strict equality operator. In fact, `===` is most often what you mean when you do comparisons, and should be your comparison operator of choice _unless you have a really good reason to allow implicit type conversions_.

### **6. For and While Loops**

In addition to if statements, another important way of controlling flow is through loops. In JavaScript, for and while loops work like in many other languages.

A `for` loop has three parts:
1. An initializing expression, where code is execute prior to the loop running the first time.
2. The condition, which is evaluated before every iteration of the loop to determine if the loop should break.
3. The increment expression, which is run after every iteration of the loop.

Perhaps the best way to appreciate how for loops work is to see them in action. In the following example, we print all of the numbers from 0 to 9.

```JavaScript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above example, we create a for loop with the three parts:
1. We intialize the variable `i` and assign it the value 0
2. Our condition is that the loop runs until `i` is no longer less than 10
3. After each loop iteration, we incremenet `i` by 1.

If you copy the code into your editor and run in it, you should see that it prints out 0 through 9, each on their own line. Note that the program does not print the value 10, because the condition check fails when i = 10.

In addition to `for` loops, there are also `while` loops. While loops simply check a condition before each loop, and then run if that condition is true. We can recreate the functionality of the for loop run above:

```JavaScript
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

In the while loop example, we initialize our variable `i` to be 0. Then, our loop runs as long as i is less than 10. Inside of our loop, we print out the current value of i, and then increment the value.

Be careful! You can easily create infinte loops if you aren't sure that your condition will eventually return false! For example, if we didn't increment i in our example, the function would just print 0 until you killed the program!

### **7. Creating a Function**

In software development it is usually advised to separate code into discrete chunks of code called functions that can be called by other parts of your program.

To declare a function, use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and a list of parameters, separated by a comma. Because JavaScript is weakly typed, you cannot specify the type of each parameter as you might do in Java or another typed language. To call a function, just use the functions name followed by parentheses with the parameters inside.

```JavaScript
function plusOne(value) {
  value++;
  return value;
}

let num = 0;
let value = plusOne(num);
console.log(value);

```


The above function should print the value 1, as the function returns 1 more than the number passed in. Does that example seem too simple? Theres actually a lot of interesting things going on in the above example.

One thing to note is that we _could_ call the function before we declare it in the same file, but it is considered bad practice. Always declare before you use.

If you were to print the value of `num` after the function runs, what would you expect it to be? You might say 1, but it is actually 0. When we pass a value into a function, we pass it by value (with a few exceptions), so the value of num cannot be changed inside the function. Instead, the parameter acts as a new variable inside of the function.

Also remember, there is no type-checking in JavaScript functions. If a string had been sent to the function, the program would have run just fine until it tried to execute the line `value++`, at which case the value of value becomes `NaN`, meaning Not-A-Number. If type-checking is important for your programs (and it probably should be), you would either have to explicity check parameter types inside the function, or use something like TypeScript, which we will cover later in the lab.

We could hold an entire lab on JavaScript functions, but for now it is important to know that you can create and call Java

### **8. Creating an Object**

Just like creating an function is important, so is creating an object.
