### **Introduction: Eradani Connect Framework**

Congratulations on getting this far! With all of the material you've covered, you're now ready to hit the real purpose of this lab: getting the latest, cutting-edge, open-source technologies to interact with existing IBM i applications. In this section, we will move our Express server over to our IBM i LPARs and set the servers up to **interact directly with Db2 and RPG on the i!** This process will effectively generalize to any other commands, programs, or data available on your IBM i, meaning that once this section is complete, you will have all of the tools required for your IBM i applications to tap into the world open-source web technology!

We will achieve this using the Eradani Connect Framework. **This framework is provided for this workshop, and will have a freely accessible development version on NPM soon.** 

The first step is to get set up on the LPARs, which we will take 15 minutes now to set up. During this point in the workshop, we will be distributing all of the necessary information for connecting to your LPAR's PASE environment and starting up Node there for development. **We will move on to the next section once this process is complete, so please enjoy your coffee break. We'll return in 15 minutes for the rest of the workshop.**

### **Moving Our Server Over to the i**

Your workshop LPARs come pre-packaged with IBM's Open Source tools enabled and SSH configured. Now that we have Node up and running, we are going to use these tools to move our Express applications from the previous section of the workshop to the i. We need two files for this: a `package.json` file and the main `app.js` file, both of which are provided below. In your PASE environment SSH session, you will need to create these two files and copy/paste their respective code into them.

You can create the files with the following two commands:

```bash
touch package.json
touch app.js
```

Then, you can manually retype the contents of each file or copy/paste them. If you decide to copy/paste them, copy the contents for the `package.json` file now (available below), then open up the `package.json` file in a text editor with the following command:

```bash
nano package.json
```

Once you have pasted or retyped the contents of the file, press `Ctrl+O` and then `Enter` to save the file, then `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor. Now repeat for the `app.js` file.

**In the app.js file, don't forget to set the port number for your application!** In the final line of app.js, you will see `server.listen('<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>');`. You have been provided with a port number - please replace the entire text string with that number (including the quotes). For example, if your port number is `2019`, then the line should be: `server.listen(2019);`.

`package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "workshop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "request": "^2.88.0",
    "request-promise": "^4.2.4",
    "eradani-connect-node": "github:eradani-inc/eradani-connect-node"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

`app.js`
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

const server = http.createServer(app);

const PORT = '<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>';
server.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server is now listening on port: ${PORT}`);
```

Once you have copied the two files, you will need to install the NPM dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

**This command may take a bit to run.**

Once it completes, run your Node application with `node app.js`.

You should then be able to navigate to the URL of the LPAR, followed by your port number in your browser to see "Hello Internet!". The URL will follow this format: `http://<LPAR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/`. For example, if the LPAR address was `www.yourlpar.com` and the port was `2019`, the full URL would be `http://www.yourlpar.com:2019/`.

If you see "Hello Internet!" in your browser, congratulations! You now have a Node application running on the IBM i! In the next section, we will add a '/customer' route that will retrieve real data from the Db2 database on the i.

### **Calling an RPG Program**

Your workshop LPAR already has a simple RPG program compiled on it, accessible at `WORKSHOP/LINUX_CALC`. For reference, the source code for this RPG program is included below.

```js
H*                                                                 
H***************************************************************   
H**   LINUX_CALC                                               *   
H***************************************************************   
H*                                                                 
C     *ENTRY        PLIST                                          
C                   PARM                    ibmicores        15 0  
C                   PARM                    linuxservers     16 0  
C     IBMICORES     MULT      20            LINUXSERVERS           
C                   seton                                        LR
```

This is a very simple RPG program, but the concepts introduced in this section will generalize to any program on your system. What this program will do is take the value of its first parameter, `ibmicores`, multiply it by 20, and store the result in its second parameter, `linuxservers`. Our goal in this section is to create a uniform interface to this RPG program so that it can be freely used in our Open Source applications.

There are two steps to our process:

1. Tell the Eradani Connect Framework where this program is located and basic information about its parameters
2. Create an API route in our Node.js application which accesses this program.

In order for the Eradani Connect Framework to generate an API for our RPG program, we need to specify basic information about the program. This is done through a _Program Model Definition_. A _Program Model Definition_ is a set of JSON data which lists at minimum the name of the program object, the library where it can be found, and a list of its available parameters. Create a new file in your editor, and name it `pgm-model.js`. 

Let's start by importing the Eradani Connect Framework module for this file. That module will contain all of the tools we need to call the RPG program:

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');
```

Once we have imported the Eradani Connect Framework module, we create a new instance of an Eradani Connect PGM interface with two arguments to begin with: the program name, and then an empty JSON object for the program's options, which we will fill in next.

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');

new eradaniConnect.run.Pgm('LINUX_CALC', {});
```

Now, the options object (second argument) will contain the rest of the information required to call this RPG program. Naturally, the next most important piece of information to call this program is the library name, which we specify with the `lib` property of the options object:

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');

new eradaniConnect.run.Pgm('LINUX_CALC', {
    lib: 'WORKSHOP'
});
```

Simple! Finally, we need to tell the Eradani Connect Framework what parameters this RPG program accepts so that the Framework can generate a uniform interface to the RPG program. This is the most complex part of any Open Source-IBM i connection because the way Open Source software communicates is fundamentally different from the way traditional IBM i software communicates. It's as if the two systems speak entirely different languages. The Eradani Connect Framework can speak both languages, so once we describe the RPG program's parameters to the Framework, it will be able to translate freely between the RPG and JavaScript parts of our application.

Looking back at the RPG program source code, we can see that there are two parameters which are both Packed Decimals:

```js
C                   PARM                    ibmicores        15 0  
C                   PARM                    linuxservers     16 0  
```

The first parameter has a length of 15, and the second parameter has a length of 16. To describe a parameter to the Eradani Connect Framework, we need at least two pieces of data in JSON format: a name for the parameter, and the data type for the parameter.

For the first parameter, that definition would look like this:

```javascript
{
    name: 'IBMICORES',
    type: new eradaniConnect.dataTypes.PackedDecimal(15, 0)
}
```

Parameter information in a Program Model file should be in a JSON array under the key `params`. So, after defining our parameters, our Program Model file will look like this:

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');

new eradaniConnect.run.Pgm('LINUX_CALC', {
    lib: 'ECNCTDEMO',
    params: [{
        name: 'IBMICORES',
        type: new eradaniConnect.dataTypes.PackedDecimal(15, 0)
    }, {
        name: 'LINUXSERVERS',
        type: new eradaniConnect.dataTypes.PackedDecimal(16, 0),
        defaultValue: 0
    }]
});
```

You may notice that we added an optional attribute to the second parameter. There are a host of optional attributes for Program Model specifications to make life easier for you, the most popular of which is the `defaultValue` attribute. If this attribute is specified, the Eradani Connect Framework will automatically use this default value for its parameter _if the program is called without a value for that parameter_. Effectively, adding a `defaultValue` attribute to a parameter makes that parameter optional. If you attempt to call an RPG program through the Eradani Connect Framework while missing a required parameter (one which does not have a `defaultValue`), the Framework will reject your program call with an Error.

We have one final step to complete this Program Model file. Though we have created an interface to our RPG program, we have not stored that interface anywhere, meaning it cannot be used yet. To fix this, we will _export_ our RPG program interface from this file, so that other JavaScript files in our application can access it. We do this by assigning the RPG program interface to the global `module.exports` object. This is a globally-available object which is built-in to Node.js and is used for exporting variables to other modules in your program.

Our completed Program Model file should look like this:

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');

module.exports = new eradaniConnect.run.Pgm('LINUX_CALC', {
    lib: 'ECNCTDEMO',
    params: [{
        name: 'IBMICORES',
        type: new eradaniConnect.dataTypes.PackedDecimal(15, 0)
    }, {
        name: 'LINUXSERVERS',
        type: new eradaniConnect.dataTypes.PackedDecimal(16, 0),
        defaultValue: 0
    }]
});
```

From this point on, we can officially call our RPG program from anywhere in our JavaScript application. Let's try it out by creating a REST API for the program.

**Switch back to your main `index.js` file**

Since we are now exporting the RPG program interface from the Program Model file, let's start by importing that interface into our `index.js` file, along with the Eradani Connect Framework module, and adding some configuration for connecting to the LPAR. Add these lines of code near the top of your `index.js` file, and be sure to fill in the required values from your lab information:

```javascript
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');
const linuxCalc = require('./pgm-model');

const config = {
    "connectionPath": {
        "host": "<Your LPAR URL>",
        "port": 47700
    },
    "username": "<Your LPAR Username>",
    "password": "<Your LPAR Password>"
}
```

**NOTE:** In a production application you would **never** store credentials in plain source code. In reality, you would supply them to the application on startup, either via console prompt or encrypted communication with an external authorization server. That being said, to keep this demo simple we are storing credentials at the top of our file.

Remember how we said way back that there are different ways to import modules? Specifying a module with a file path like `./pgm-model` tells Node that it should look for the module in a file in the same directory as our current file, rather than looking directly in the `node_modules` folder for a module installed from NPM. You may notice that we don't have to add the `.js` to the file name. Node automatically checks for several different file extensions, including `.js`.

Next, let's create a standard Express route definition for the route `/linux-calc`. Your `index.js` file should now look like this:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');
const linuxCalc = require('./pgm-model');

const config = {
    "connectionPath": {
        "host": "<Your LPAR URL>",
        "port": 47700
    },
    "username": "<Your LPAR Username>",
    "password": "<Your LPAR Password>"
}

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
});

app.get('/linux-calc', function(request, response) {
    //Call our RPG program!
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

const PORT = '<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>';
server.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server is now listening on port: ${PORT}`);
```

Now we just need to call the RPG program in our API route and return the result to our clients. Inside the new `/linux-calc` API route, we need to open a connection to our LPAR and tell the Framework to run our program.

Let's zoom in on the new route definition:

```javascript
app.get('/linux-calc', function(request, response) {
    //Open a connection to our LPAR
    const connection = new eradaniConnect.transports.Xml("*LOCAL", config.username, config.password, config.connectionPath);
    //Call our RPG program!   
    linuxCalc.run(connection, {
        IBMICORES: request.query.num
    });
});
```

In this case, we are using the XML transport for our program call, which will generate a call to the XMLService web service on your LPAR. Then, we just need to take the program interface we imported from `pgm-model.js` and run the program, passing in the url query parameter `num` for the `IBMICORES` parameter. This means that our API can be called by sending an HTTP GET request to `http://<Your Server URL>/linux-calc?num=5`.

**There is just one last step, and then we'll be done.** You may have noticed that our API route doesn't return any data, so when you call this API, the RPG program will run but its result will not be returned to you. Let's fix that.

When executing a program, the Eradani Connect Framework returns a `Promise` which will contain the output of the program. If you need a refresher on Promises, check the [Node.js section of this workshop](./4.nodejs.md#promises).

So, we need to use the `.then` handler of the Promise returned by the Framework to send data back to our clients. Add a `.then` handler to the program call which sets the response status code to `200` (OK) and sends the value of the program Promise to `response.json()`:

```javascript
app.get('/linux-calc', function(request, response) {
    //Open a connection to our LPAR
    const connection = new eradaniConnect.transports.Xml("*LOCAL", config.username, config.password, config.connectionPath);
    //Call our RPG program!   
    linuxCalc.run(connection, {
        IBMICORES: request.query.num
    }).then(function(result) {
        response.status(200).json(result);
    });
});
```

Congratulations! You should now have a working API around this RPG program. Test it out by running your application, and then visiting your new route in a new tab of your browser. The URL should be something like: `http://<Your Server URL>/linux-calc?num=5`.

Your should see JSON output that looks something like `[{"IBMICORES":"5","LINUXSERVERS":"100"}]`. You can see here that the `IBMICORES` parameter is still `5`, and the `LINUXSERVERS` parameter is 5 x 20 (`100`).

**Quick Recap**: This was a heavy section, so don't worry if some of it seemed complex. Essentially what we did was:
1. Describe our RPG program to the Eradani Connect Framework
2. Let the Eradani Connect Framework generate a reusable JavaScript interface to our RPG program
3. Open a connection to our LPAR so that we can call the program
4. Create an API route in our application which calls our RPG program and returns the result

The core of the Eradani Connect Framework is Program Model Files. These files allow the Framework to generate reusable, universal interfaces to IBM i resources which you can then use throughout your program.

In the next section, we will use a similar model file to interface with Db2 and run SQL queries!

#UNFINISHED

### **Connecting to Db2**

It's surprisingly simple to work with the Node.js `eradani-connect-node`. The first step would be to install the Eradani Connect Framework package. However, we actually already took care of this while setting up the LPARs. If you would like, check out the `package.json` file that we have for our current server. Under dependencies, you should see `eradani-connect-node` installed! If it isn't there, add it to the list by adding `"eradani-connect-node": "github:eradani-inc/eradani-connect-node"` into the dependencies list, saving the file, and then running `npm install` to install the dependency package.

Now, the first thing we are going to do is add a new route at `/customer` which we will fill in later. Add the following code in the same area as the other routes we've created:

```javascript
app.get('/customer', function (request, response) {
    // Fill in later!
});
```

Your complete server file should now look something like this. If you decide to copy/paste this file, **make sure that your port number is still right at the bottom of the file!**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

// Import Eradani Connect Framework
const eradaniConnect = require('eradani-connect-node');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

// New Route!
app.get('/customer', function (request, response) {
    // Fill in later!
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

const PORT = '<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>';
server.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server is now listening on port: ${PORT}`);
```

Great! For now, feel free to copy and paste this function at the bottom of your `app.js` file. We will go through it in a moment. **Make sure to replace the `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` text with your LPAR username and password!**

```javascript
// Configuration options
const xmlConfig = {
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
    "connection": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 47700,
        "path": "/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm",
    }
};
// Function to send SQL queries to Db2 to execute
function executeQuery(sql) {
    // Create a new Promise
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Open a connection to Db2
        const conn = new Eradani Connect Framework.iConn("*LOCAL", xmlConfig.username, xmlConfig.password, xmlConfig.connection);

        // Create a SQL command using the text in the sql variable at the top of this function
        const command = new Eradani Connect Framework.iSql();
        command.addQuery(sql);
        command.fetch();
        command.free();
        conn.add(command);

        // Run the SQL command, and then return the result
        conn.run((response) => {
            resolve(response);
        });
    });
}
```

Once you paste this code in, we won't have done anything with it yet, so the function will not run. The next step is to update our route so that it runs this function and passes it the SQL command `SELECT * FROM QIWS.QCUSTCDT`. This table comes premade for you on the IBM i and returns some simulated customer data. We can run this SQL command by calling our function from inside our `/customer` route with this code:

```javascript
    return executeQuery('SELECT * FROM QIWS.QCUSTCDT')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        });
```

This code will run our function, and then take the Promise which it returns and attach a `.then()` handler to it. This means that once Db2 returns a result from our query, lines 3 and 4 will be run with the result data from the query available in the `result` variable.

Our completed server file should now look like this:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

// Import Eradani Connect Framework
const Eradani Connect Framework = require('Eradani Connect Framework');

const requestPromise = require('request-promise');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello Internet!');
});

app.get('/hello', function(request, response) {
    response.end('Hello, ' + request.query.name);
});

app.get('/data', function (request, response) {
    requestPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        .then(result => {
            console.log(result);
            response.end(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            response.status(500).end(error);
        });
})

// New Route!
app.get('/customer', function (request, response) {
    return executeQuery('SELECT * FROM QIWS.QCUSTCDT')
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result);
        response.end(result);
    });
});

// Configuration options
const xmlConfig = {
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
    "connection": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 47700,
        "path": "/cgi-bin/xmlcgi.pgm",
    }
};
// Function to send SQL queries to Db2 to execute
function executeQuery(sql) {
    // Create a new Promise
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Open a connection to Db2
        const conn = new Eradani Connect Framework.iConn("*LOCAL", xmlConfig.username, xmlConfig.password, xmlConfig.connection);

        // Create a SQL command using the text in the sql variable at the top of this function
        const command = new Eradani Connect Framework.iSql();
        command.addQuery(sql);
        command.fetch();
        command.free();
        conn.add(command);

        // Run the SQL command, and then return the result
        conn.run((response) => {
            resolve(response);
        });
    });
}

const server = http.createServer(app);

const PORT = '<REPLACE THIS STRING WITH YOUR PORT NUMBER>';
server.listen(PORT);
console.log(`Server is now listening on port: ${PORT}`);
```

**If you copy/paste this code make sure your `port`, `username`, and `password` are all correct!**

And now, for the moment of truth. Once your have made sure your server is up-to-date, run the server with the command:

```bash
node app.js
```

Wait a few seconds for the application to start up, then navigate to the URL of your application in your browser. Remember, the format for the URL is `http://<LPAR_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/`. If you see 'Hello Internet!' in your browser, then your server is running, and it is time to check if our Db2 operation works.

Navigate to the `/customer` route in your browser. The URL format in this case would be `http://<LPAR_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/customer`. It may take a few seconds for this operation to complete, but once it does, you should see some XML text in the browser window, and interspersed in the angle brackets (<,>), you should see the data from the `customers` in the database!

### **Conclusion**

Now that we have built a basic Express server that runs commands on the IBM i, it is theoretically possible for us to build any open-source web application which communicates with any other IBM i application using the tools we have discussed here! These past few sections have packed a lot of content, but they will give you the basics of what you need to get started building modern REST interfaces for your IBM i applications.

The next sections will cover best practices for building production-worthy applications for the i. Good luck!
