# **Node.js Workshop**

### [Previous: TypeScript](./7.typescript.md)

## **Conclusion**

Node.js is a powerful tool for quickly creating applications to sit on top of your existing business logic. Through a number of packages developed by Eradani, IBM, and other third-party vendors, Node.js can interact directly with the IBM i, calling RPG programs, CL commands, and interacting with the Db2 database. Furthermore, with over 1 million open-source packages available on NPM, you can leverage battle-tested code as the foudnation for your application, allowing you to focus on writing your business' application logic!

We hope that this lab has given you a solid foundation to continue your Node.js education. In this session, we learned how to develop in JavaScript, became familiar with the Node.js runtime, and developed an application to serve up IBM i Db2 data using Express.js. We have also included an extension lesson in this lab covering TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that allows for strong typing, which we encourage you to check out at your own pace.

If you have any questions about the content of the lab or any related questions about Node.js, feel free to reach out to Aaron Magid, VP of Open Source Technologies at Eradani (aaron@eradani.com), or post an issue on [the GitHub repository that hosts this lab](https://github.com/eradani-inc/nodejs-workshop).

Happy coding!
